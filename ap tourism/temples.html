The local lore goes that the wounded Jatayu (not Lalmohanbabu but the great bird from Ramayan he borrowed his pen name from) fell on a rocky hillock in this village while trying to stop the demon king Ravan from abducting Sita. Sadly, Ravan won the fight and left him to die after clipping his wings. When Ram arrived at the spot, he compassionately uttered the words, “Le Pakshi”, which means “Rise, bird”, in Telugu. Thus, the place came to be known as Lepakshi.</h3>

Every day he used to paint the form of Sri Anjaneya Swami on a stone in front of him with sandalwood which he wears . Every time Hanuman was painted like that , he would wear his true form and go away from there. Observing this, Vyasa Rayala made a yantra with the bijaksharas of Swami's Dwadasha names, and painted the true form of Sri Anjaneya Swami in it, so that Hanuman's energy could not go elsewhere. So Swami got trapped in that machine and stayed in it.

                One day when Vyasaraya was sleeping in the temple of Sri Bhogeshwara Swamy in Chippagiri mandal in present day Kurnool district , Anjaneyaswamy came in a dream and said, "I am in a certain area, build me a temple." When Vyasa asked Raya to tell him where that area was, Swami blessed him like this - "If you go towards the south, you will see a dry neem tree, if you go near it, Adi will sprout, there I will be in the earth". Vyasa Rayalu gets up early the next morning and travels south and finally finds that dry neem tree. As Raya approaches the tree, the tree sprouts. Surprised, Vyasaraya immediately digs the earth there. An idol of one-eyed Anjaneyaswamy is found in excavations. Rayalavaru enshrines the idol with great devotion and builds a temple.
                
                Every year a tanner makes and offers a pair of sandals to Anjaneya Swami who is a single devotee and observes celibacy. It is remarkable that when it comes the next day, it looks worn and torn. Devotees believe that Swami wears those sandals and goes on vacations at night. Swami's Grace Every year during the months of Vaisakh , Sravana , Kartika and Magha , countless devotees visit Swami and fulfill their wishes on Saturdays .
