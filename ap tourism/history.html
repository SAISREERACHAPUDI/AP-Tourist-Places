            <h3>Gandikota is a village and historical fort on the right bank of the Penna river, 15 km from Jammalamadugu in Kadapa district, Andhra Pradesh, India. The fort was the centre of power for various dynasties, such as the Kalyani Chalukyas, Pemmasani Nayakas, and the Golconda Sultanate. A sand fort was constructed by Kaka Raja, Vassals of Kalyani Chalukya rulers. Various additions of Islamic architecture were made during subsequent Muslim rule.The fort of Gandikota acquired its name due to the 'gorge', formed between the Erramala range of hills, also known as Gandikota hills and the river Penna (Pennar) that flows at its foot, reducing its width to a mere 100 m (look for the river image in the montage/main image).In November 2015, Andhra Pradesh government cited a plan to develop Gandikota as next major tourist hub of Andhra Pradesh</h3>

            <h3> According to the book "A History of South India", the Tuluva Vira Narasimharayas, who ruled the Vijayanagara Empire between 1505-1509, gifted the Kandanaveedu fort to Araveedu Ramaraja. These Thulvaveera Narasimharayas are also known as Immadi Narasanayakudu. Here are some facts about the history of "Kandanavolu" fort. Yusuf Adil Khan, the Sultan of Bijapur, crossed the Tungabhadra river and attacked the fort of Kandanavolu. At that time Araveedu Rama Raja stood by Thulvaveera Narasimha and helped him to oust Bijapur Sultan and capture Kandanavolu fort as well as Adoni. With that, the Lord of Vijayanagara, Veeranarasimha appreciated Ramaraja and gifted him the Kandanavolu fort.  It is believed that the Kondareddy Fort was built during the Vijayanagara Empire.  As part of the expansion of the city, all the walls of this fort were removed during the British period. </h3></div>
